"""The ORM models. Persistence is `repositories/`' business (AD-1, the spine's source tree).

Implements: FR-01 (an Employee authenticates with email + password), FR-04 (a
deactivated Employee cannot authenticate), AD-10 (every read is scoped — the columns
that scope it, `department_id` and `manager_id`, live here), AD-14 (`password_hash` is
where the bcrypt digest is stored, never the password), AD-23 (`CHECK (id <> manager_id)`
is a *backstop* for the reporting-cycle refusal — the gate itself is the employee
service in Story 1.6). SM-6: every model names the requirements it serves.

Why `department` and `employee` arrive together, in this story rather than Story 1.5:
`employee.department_id` is NOT NULL (PRD §3 — every Employee belongs to exactly one
Department), so the Admin seeded here (AC2) needs a Department to belong to. Story 1.5
adds the Department *endpoints*; the table has to exist before an Admin can be seeded.

These models must stay byte-for-byte faithful to migration `0002` — `alembic check`
emits an empty diff only while they agree, and `tests/integration/test_model_migration_agreement.py`
runs that check in the suite so a drift fails the build. Change one, change both, in the
same commit.

    projection, never stored), AD-17 (only `services/balances.py` writes any quantity column
    here), SM-5 (a Leave Type added through the API immediately has a balance to apply against).

    Three quantities are STORED — `accrued` (what was granted), `reserved` (committed to Pending

    entitlement` and `carried_forward` are the two parts `accrued` composes from (`accrued =

    row was accrued under, which FR-06's RECALCULATE recalculates *from* (ERD §2.1). Every column
    is plain `INTEGER` — a Leave Day is a whole number of days, never `NUMERIC`/float (DR-10).

    `reserved` and `consumed` carry `server_default=0` so a freshly materialized row (through
    `set_accrual`'s insert, which names only the accrual triple) defaults them to 0 — keeping
    `reserve`/`consume_*` the only paths that ever *change* a committed/spent quantity.

    its rows been written into `audit_entry`, "SM-4 would have been false the day it was written",
    because the rollover transitions no Leave Request and SM-4 counts audit rows one-to-one
    against transitions), AD-9 / NFR-09 (append-only is a GRANT: `0009` grants the application
    role `INSERT` and `SELECT` on this table and NEITHER `UPDATE` NOR `DELETE`; nothing was
    inherited, because `0008` deliberately issued no `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`). SM-6.

    Exactly the ERD's two attributes, plus the `uuidv7()` primary key every table here carries:

    - `leave_year` — "The Leave Year rolled", i.e. the year the run CLOSED (`Y`), never the year
      it opened (`Y + 1`). `python -m app.jobs.rollover --year 2026` reads 2026's balances,
      materializes 2027's, and writes `leave_year = 2026`.
    - `occurred_at` — "The moment." A `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, set from the service shell
      (AD-1), exactly like `audit_entry.occurred_at`.

    There is deliberately NO `actor` column — the ERD: "Actor is always `SYSTEM`; no column is
    needed to say so." And deliberately NO `UNIQUE (leave_year)`: this table logs EXECUTIONS, not
    years. A second run against the same year is legal and appends a second row; idempotence (AC5)
    is a property of the BALANCES — `set_accrual` ASSIGNS a derived value rather than accumulating
    one — not of this log. A unique constraint here would turn a legal no-op re-run into an
    `IntegrityError`, which is why the ERD names none and why none is invented.

    Implements: AD-19 (a recalculation that would drive Available negative leaves that Employee ×
    Leave Type pair ENTIRELY unchanged, records a flag, and lets the rest of the operation commit —
    the endpoint returns `200`, not an error), AD-20 (this is the THIRD append-only table and it is
    NOT `audit_entry`: a refused recalculation transitions no Leave Request, so SM-4's one-to-one

    application role `INSERT` and `SELECT` and NEITHER `UPDATE` NOR `DELETE`). AC1. SM-6.

    The refusal is recorded per (Employee, Leave Type) PAIR, because that pair is the unit of
    refusal — the same Employee's OTHER Leave Types still recalculate, and the rest of the holiday
    edit still commits:

    - `employee_id` + `leave_type_id` — the pair the recalculation left ENTIRELY unchanged. AC1
      requires BOTH, so this is not the polymorphic `subject_id` the stale ERD diagram in
      `ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md:317-321` shows. A single opaque id could not say which Leave Type was
      refused, and the Admin's screen (AC9) must name it.
    - `leave_year` — the edited Leave Year, `holiday_date.year`. A flag that cannot say WHICH year
      it refused is not actionable (Open Decision #2). Every affected request has this leave year by
      construction: DR-6 forbids a request spanning two Leave Years, so a holiday on date `D` can
      only fall inside a request whose Leave Year is `D.year`.
    - `cause` — which refusal raised it (`vocabulary.CAUSE_HOLIDAY_RECALCULATION`; Story 2.12 adds
      `CAUSE_POLICY_RECALCULATION` beside it).
    - `occurred_at` — the moment, a `TIMESTAMPTZ` set from the service shell (AD-1), exactly like
      `audit_entry.occurred_at` and `rollover_run.occurred_at`. The AC names `occurred_at`; the ERD
      §ADMIN_REVIEW_FLAG says `raised_at`, and the AC is binding (Open Decision #1).

    --- There is NO `resolved_at`, and there is no endpoint that clears a flag ---

    Deliberately, and it is the whole of AD-20's second half. `FR-10` grants the Admin only a READ
    of these flags; no requirement grants a RESOLVE. ERD §6 (GAP-4) states the consequence outright:
    "there is no `resolved_at` column and no endpoint clears a flag. A flag is a permanent record
    that a recalculation was refused … The undefined behavior is gone because the behavior no longer
    exists." A `resolved_at` column would also silently justify the `UPDATE` grant that AC1 forbids,
    which is how an append-only guarantee dies with every test still green.

class PolicyChange(Base):
    """A Leave Type policy edit, and the disposition the Admin chose for it (Story 2.12).

    Implements: FR-06's last clause (an Admin changing policy is FORCED to say what happens to the
    balances that already exist — the system never silently decides on their behalf), AD-8 (this is
    the FOURTH append-only table and it is NOT `audit_entry`: a policy change transitions no Leave
    Request, so SM-4's one-to-one count of audit rows against transitions stays literally true —
    the same reasoning that gave `rollover_run` and `admin_review_flag` their own tables), AD-9 /
    NFR-09 (append-only is a GRANT: `0011` grants the application role `INSERT` and `SELECT` and
    NEITHER `UPDATE` NOR `DELETE`). AC1, AC3. SM-6.

    ONE ROW PER CHANGED BALANCE-AFFECTING ATTRIBUTE (Open Decision #4). The table is SINGULAR —
    `attribute`, `old_value`, `new_value` — so a `PATCH` that changes both `annual_entitlement` and
    `carry_forward_cap` writes TWO rows, sharing one `occurred_at` and one `disposition`. A `name`
    change writes NONE: `disposition` is NOT NULL under a two-value CHECK, and a name change has no
    disposition to record. (The alternative — one row per PATCH with a JSON blob, or a nullable
    disposition — is refused by AC1's CHECK, which admits exactly two values and no NULL.)

    - `leave_type_id` — the Leave Type edited. NOT NULL; the row is meaningless without it.
    - `attribute` — WHICH attribute moved (`annual_entitlement`, `carry_forward_cap`,
      `carries_forward`). A plain column name, not an enumerated vocabulary value: these are the
      names of columns on `leave_type`, and inventing a parallel vocabulary for them would be a
      second source of truth for a set the schema already fixes.
    - `old_value` / `new_value` — TEXT, because one column pair carries an `int`, a NULLABLE int and
      a `bool` (erd.md L151-152). Stringified at the service boundary; a `None` cap is rendered as
      the string `"null"`, so the columns stay NOT NULL and "the cap was REMOVED" is distinguishable
      from "there never was a cap" (Open Decision #6).
    - `disposition` — `RECALCULATE` or `PRESERVE`, under `CHECK (disposition IN (…))`. AC1's one
      non-negotiable constraint, and a BACKSTOP, never a gate (AD-5): the service validates against
      the two `vocabulary.DISPOSITION_*` constants and raises `400 POLICY_DISPOSITION_REQUIRED`
      before any write, so the CHECK never surfaces as a raw 500.
    - `occurred_at` — the moment, a `TIMESTAMPTZ` set from the service shell (AD-1), exactly like
      `audit_entry.occurred_at`, `rollover_run.occurred_at` and `admin_review_flag.occurred_at`.
      The AC (and the epic) name `occurred_at`; erd.md L154 says `changed_at`, and the AC is
      binding — the same clash Story 2.11 hit (`raised_at` vs `occurred_at`) and resolved the same
      way.

    --- There is NO actor column, BY DECISION (AC1, AD-20) ---

    Not an omission, and not a gap to be filled by a helpful later story. PRD §1 promises
    attribution for LEAVE REQUEST state changes — that is what `audit_entry.actor_type`/`actor_id`
    exist for. It promises no attribution for a configuration change, and the ERD names no actor
    column here. The row records WHAT changed, FROM what, TO what, under WHICH disposition, and
    WHEN; the Admin role gate on `PATCH /leave-types/{id}` already guarantees who could have caused
    it. `rollover_run` makes the same call for the same reason ("Actor is always SYSTEM; no column
    is needed to say so").

class Notification(Base):
    """An in-app Notification — the FIRST table here that is not append-only (Story 3.4).

    Implements: FR-14 (a Manager learns a decision is waiting; an applicant learns theirs was made),
    AD-16 (the governing decision, all four clauses: a Notification carries a recipient, a `kind`
    discriminator, the Leave Request it concerns, a nullable `read_at` and `created_at`; the unread
    count is `COUNT(*) WHERE read_at IS NULL` and is NEVER stored; the service that performs a
    transition is the service that writes its Notification, INSIDE that transition's transaction, so
    one exists if and only if the transition committed; mark-read is an idempotent `PATCH` permitted
    only to its addressee), AD-8 (a Notification is NOT an audit row — see below), NFR-09. AC1. SM-6.

    - `recipient_employee_id` — WHO it is addressed to. NOT NULL, and that is load-bearing: AC4's
      managerless applicant writes NO `REQUEST_SUBMITTED` "because it would have no addressee", so
      the naive unconditional insert hits this constraint rather than quietly storing a headless row.
    - `leave_request_id` — WHICH Leave Request it concerns. NOT NULL; all three kinds concern one.
    - `kind` — `REQUEST_SUBMITTED`, `REQUEST_APPROVED` or `REQUEST_REJECTED`, under a three-value
      CHECK. EXACTLY three: `services/cancellation.py` writes ZERO Notifications (readiness F-4,
      epics.md:473 — an Admin discovers a Cancellation Request through `GET /cancellation-requests`,
      not a notification), and the `reviews/` proposal to add `CANCELLATION_*` kinds was NOT adopted.
    - `read_at` — the ONLY nullable column and the ONLY mutable one. NULL ⇒ unread. There is no
      stored `is_read` flag and no stored count; both would be a second source of truth for a fact
      this column already carries (AD-16).
    - `created_at` — the moment, a `TIMESTAMPTZ` from the service shell (AD-1).

    --- It is NOT `audit_entry`, and there is no `SUBJECT_NOTIFICATION` ---

    A Notification is not a state transition — it is a consequence of one. AD-8 reserves
    `audit_entry` for "exactly one row per state transition of a Leave Request or a Cancellation
    Request, AND NOTHING ELSE", and that last clause is what keeps SM-4's exact count (14 rows, with
    its per-`subject_type` breakdown) literally true. `rollover_run`, `admin_review_flag` and
    `policy_change` each got their own table for precisely this reason; `notification` is the log of
    itself. Echoing `services/rollover.py`: there is no `SUBJECT_NOTIFICATION` and there must not be
    one. This story adds ZERO `insert_audit_entry` call sites.

    --- The append-only rule does NOT apply here (AD-9), and the grant says so ---

    AD-9's append-only list is exactly `audit_entry` and `rollover_run`. `read_at` is mutable, so
    `0012` grants the application role `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` — NOT the `INSERT, SELECT` shape
    `0009`/`0010`/`0011` all used. `DELETE` is still withheld (no requirement deletes a
    Notification). Copying the append-only grant would leave `PATCH …/read` failing at RUNTIME with
    `InsufficientPrivilege` while the unit suite stayed green.

    --- The partial index ---

    `ix_notification_recipient_unread` on `recipient_employee_id WHERE read_at IS NULL` (AC1, ERD
    §4.4) — the codebase's FIRST partial index. It indexes exactly the set AD-16's unread count
    counts. ⚠️ `alembic check` CANNOT see the predicate (Alembic 1.18.5 never compares
    `postgresql_where`), so a plain non-partial index here would pass every schema guard while
    silently failing AC1 — `tests/integration/test_notifications.py` asserts the predicate against
    `pg_indexes.indexdef`, and it is the only thing that does.

    Deliberately ABSENT — each a decision, not an omission:
